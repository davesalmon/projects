 *	Implement DlAssert for debugging. This assert macro uses the DlException::Display()
 *	method for displaying the assert. This makes it useful in GUI applications where 
 *  there is not typically a console. It can also be used for console applications by
 *	changing the alert display definiton (SetExceptionDisplay()).
