<div class="subsection" id="section1-1">

<p class="Plain">Plane linear frame analysis consists of discretizing a plane
structure into beam and column segments (elements), connected to each other at
joint points (nodes). Each node can move in 3 directions (degrees of freedom):
horizontally (x), vertically (y), and rotationally (<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>&#952;</span>). Plane-Frame Analysis assumes that the behavior of
the structure remains elastic throughout the deformation, i.e., if the loads
are removed the structure will return to its original shape.</p>

<p class="Plain">After defining the nodes and elements for the frame,
structural properties (modulus of elasticity, area, and moment of inertia) must
be assigned to each element. Additionally, a sufficient number of degrees of
freedom must be restrained to prevent the structure or portions of it from
moving as a rigid body.</p>

<p class="Plain">After the structure has been defined, load cases are assigned
consisting of node and element loads to be applied to the structure.</p>

<p class="Plain">Based on the structure definition and the defined load
cases, the structure can be analyzed and the internal forces (shear, moment,
and axial force) and the displacements can be determined. Plane-Frame Analysis shows
these results graphically superimposed on the structure.</p>

<div class="subsection" id="section1-2">

<p class="Plain">Each unconstrained degree of freedom can potentially move
due to the forces applied to the structure. This motion is resisted by the
elements proportionally to their respective stiffness. Plane-Frame Analysis assumes
that the behavior of each of the members and their connections to each other
remain elastic throughout the deformation.</p>

<p class="Plain">A set of linear simultaneous equations is constructed, one
for each unrestrained degree of freedom.</p>

<p class="Plain">[K]{x} = {b}</p>

<p class="Plain">where [K] is the stiffness matrix, {x} is a vector of
deformations in each unconstrained degree of freedom, and {b} is the load
vector.</p>

<p class="Plain">Each element in the structure contributes some resistance to
deformation in each of the degrees of freedom to which it is attached. The
combination of these resistances forms the stiffness matrix.</p>

<p class="Plain">The loads applied to the structure contribute to the load
vector. Loads may be applied directly to the nodes, or may be distributed along
the length of the elements. In addition, pre-stress within elements due to
thermal loading or pre tensioning may also contribute to the load vector.</p>

<p class="Plain">After the equations have been constructed, they are solved for the deformations
in each degree of freedom. These deformations are subsequently used to determine the internal
forces (bending moment, shear force, and axial force) present in each element. </p>

<p class="Plain">A structure is created using the tools from the Tools panel (Fig
1). The node creation tool
<span>
	<img width="18" height="18" src="images/add-node.png"/>
</span> is used to create new nodes
for the structure. When this tool is active, any click in the main view will create a new node
point at that location. A grid is optionally provided (see Workspace) to assist in locating these nodes.</p>

<p class="Plain">The created nodes are connected into a structure using the element creation
tool <span><img width="18" height="18" src="images/add-element.png"/></span>.
The element creation tool will create a new element
between a selected node and either an existing node if one is clicked on, or a new node if the
clicked location is not near any existing node. Holding the option key will temporarily change the
element creation tool into the selection tool to allow quickly changing the selected node while
creating the structure.</p>

<p class="Figure">
	<img id="figure1" width="296" height="222" src="images/tools-window.png"/>
</p>

<p class="Caption">Figure 1. Tools panel.</p>

<p class="Plain">The restraint assignment buttons in the second box within the
tools window are used to restrain various degrees of freedom. Proceeding clockwise from
the top-left they are: no restraint; restrain <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&#952;</span>
only; restrain x and <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&#952;</span>;

<div class="subsection" id="section2-2">

<p class="Plain">The units menu in the tools window can be used to select the
units to use for the structure. There are three choices: Consistent, English, and SI.</p>

<p class="Plain">Consistent units imply that the units used for force,
distance, area, moment of inertia, and modulus of elasticity are all consistent.
For example, pound, inch, inch<sup>2</sup>, inch<sup>4</sup>, and pounds/inch<sup>2</sup>.
 Such units are typically used when only the relative stiffnesses between the various structural
 elements are known.</p>

<p class="Plain">English units are the standard set of units used in the
United States: Forces in kips, dimensions in feet, moment of inertia in inch<sup>4</sup>,
modulus of elasticity in ksi, area in inch<sup>2</sup>, and displacement in
inches.</p>

<p class="Plain">SI (international) units are the standard units in most of
the rest of the world. Forces in kN, dimensions in m, moment of inertia in mm<sup>4</sup>,
modulus of elasticity in kPa, and displacements in mm.</p>

<p class="Plain">Note that the units for any specified quantity entered may
be specified along with the value for that entity. The application will convert
the value into the required units.</p>

<div class="subsection" id="section2-3">

<p class="Plain">The workspace is the coordinate system scaling and grid
spacing used when defining a structure. It can be modified using the workspace
panel (Fig. 3).</p>

<p class="Figure">
	<img id="figure3" width="236" height="366" src="images/workspace-panel.png"/>
</p>

<p class="Caption">Figure 3. Workspace panel.</p>

<p class="Plain">The world dimensions define the coordinate system of the
window in which the structure is created. The world dimensions should be
selected such that the structure being analyzed fits within the bounds. By
default a window with 40 units in each direction is created with gridlines
spaced one unit apart.</p>

<p class="Plain">An optional grid may be drawn behind the structure. The spacing of the
grid is set in the workspace panel. The checkboxes are used to specify if the grid is
visible and if grid snap is enabled.</p>

<p class="Plain">If grid snap
is enabled, nodes added or selected within a radius of 25% of the grid spacing to a grid
intersection will be assumed to have ocurred on the grid. This allows accurate placement
and selection of nodes.</p>

<p class="Plain">The scale defines the mapping between the screen and the
world. For the workspace shown in Fig. 3, the world is 20 meters in width and
height, and one inch on the screen corresponds to 1.0 meter. The scale must be sufficiently large
that the world dimensions completely fill the window.</p>

	</h2>
</a>

<div class="subsection" id="section2-5">

<p class="Plain">One quick method of creating a larger structure is to construct a representative
sample of it and to use copy and paste to generate the rest. When node and elements are
pasted into the structure they originated from, they retain all the properties and loads
from the original copy. This means you can create a representative bay of one floor of the
structure and copy that to generate all the other bays.</p>

<p class="Plain">When a portion of a structure is placed such that one or more nodes overlap existing nodes,
a dialog is presented asking if the nodes should be combined. Combining the nodes removes
all the overlapping nodes and elements (Figure 4).

</a>

<div class="section" id="section4">

<p class="Plain">Loads may be applied to the structure either directly to
nodes or distributed along the length of the elements. Typically loads are
divided into several categories including dead load, and one or more live load
case.</p>

<p class="Plain">Dead loads are loads that are typically well known such as
the weight of the structure itself or the weight of permanent fixtures in the
structure.</p>

<p class="Plain">Live loads consist of people, things, wind, seismic loads,
etc that may be applied to the structure during its life. These loads are
typically not well known.</p>

<p class="Plain">Loads are described using the Node Loads (Fig. 7) and
Element Loads (Fig. 8) lists. You can create as many different load
configurations as you want and assign each configuration to one or more
elements.</p>

<p class="Figure">
	<img id="figure7" width="421" height="242" src="images/nodeload-panel.png"/>
</p>

<p class="Caption">Figure 7. Node load panel.</p>

<p class="Plain">Each button in the node load list can be clicked to toggle
between point forces applied to a node, and specified displacement. It makes
sense only to applied specified displacement to degrees of freedom that are
constrained. Such specified displacements can be used to evaluate the structure
subject to support settlement.</p>

<p class="Caption">Figure 8. Element load panel.</p>

<p class="Plain">The rows in the element load list define load cases to be
applied to the elements in the structure. For example, the weight of a beam or
the pressure of the wind on the side of the frame would be defined as a lateral
distributed load. Thermal loads can be applied as pre-force, while pre-moment
could be used to simulated post-tensioning of concrete beams.</p>
