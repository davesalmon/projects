# StructLib

contains Structural Analysis methods for analyzing plane frame structures. This project needs to be combined with the libraries from Common/Util and Common/Recipes. The easiest way to do that is to create a workspace in Projects and add in the libraries. These libraries together are used to build a Plane-Frame analysis application.

gtest is for unit testing ala Google.
